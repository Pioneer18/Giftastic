# Giftastic
this app allows the user to enter custom searches to the giphy api and easily view the searched giphs on their device. The returned gifs are responsive, that is they will play and stop playing when clicked on. The app works on any size device. This project was coded during the UCF Coding Boot Camp by Jonathan Sells. Please enjoy!
